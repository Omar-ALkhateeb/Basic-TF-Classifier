# Body-Type Classifier

Simple tf body type Classifier with TensorFlow (Python).

The classifier is not so accurate (80% accuracy, depending on the size of the dataset and the noise) because no filter was applied since this is just a simple example. You can add your own filter. Remember this is a classifier based on human perception, not on a mathematical calculus, that's why noise is not easy to remove.
